# Watcher of Friends Online

This script works with social network [vk.com](https://vk.com).
The script displays names and surnames of user friends who are
online right now.

# How to Install

Python 3 should already be installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember that it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# Quick Start

Having ran the script a user should enter VK login and password.

To run script on Linux:
```bash
$ vk_friends_online.py
Enter VK login: 12345
Enter VK password: ******
Your online friends:
Павел Фёдоров
Василий Петров
```
Windows usage is the same.

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
